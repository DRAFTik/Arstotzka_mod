### Subtype Descriptions ###
 totalist_subtype_desc: "Totalism is a generalized name for regimes based on various forms of totalitarian, vanguardist or extremely authoritarian branches of socialism. Originally originated as an association of a number of socialist parties with a clear national bias, over time the term has become entrenched in a whole range of authoritarian leftist movements, although not all of them are ready to recognize this. In the international arena, totalism is primarily associated with Arstotzka and her political system, which has become the most vivid embodiment of this ideology."
 syndicalist_subtype_desc: "Syndicalism is a radical revolutionary ideology based on the principles of direct action, workers' self—government and the organization of society through production syndicates (trade unions) and industrial unions. The syndicalist worldview is based on the belief that economics and politics should be governed not by the state apparatus or parties, but by the workers themselves, united by professional and sectoral characteristics.\nHaving emerged in Arstotzke as the main force of the early revolution, it was later supplanted by statist totalism, but took root in other countries as the main alternative to state socialism."
 communitarianist_subtype_desc: "Communitarianism is a trend of socialism that grew out of the traditions of communal self—government and collective labor. His supporters view society as a network of equal communities linked by common solidarity and shared responsibility. Supporters of communitarianism formulate their vision of supreme power as an assembly of representatives of local communities who make key decisions and coordinate the life of the state.\nCommunitarianism is traditionally associated with agrarian regions and segments of the population, where rooted forms of cooperation and mutual assistance have become the natural basis for building a new system. This ideology strives to create a stable and just society in which harmony and cohesion are placed above individual ambitions and political interests."
 market_liberal_subtype_desc: "Market Liberal governments are derived from classical liberalism, and have their roots in various Enlightenment philosophies. Espousing the sanctity of the freedom of the individual and typically championing representative government and free enterprise, this category represents a broad assortment of groups including free market liberals, national liberals and conservative liberals."
 social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Social Conservativism encompasses many democratic governments that seek to preserve, uphold, or reinforce their peoples' traditional values in face of changing circumstances. Its adherents are not rigidly reactionary, being generally supportive of the rule of law and democracy, and willing to seek measured, incremental changes that align with their ethos within the political systems they inhabit."
 stratocratic_apologetism_subtype_desc: "Stratocratic apologetism is an ideology in which the army is seen as the highest guarantee of order and stability of the state. In times of crisis, it is the military that assumes responsibility for governing the country, justifying this by the need to protect society from radicals and preserve the foundations of democracy. Power may be temporary, but it often develops into a long-term system where democratic institutions exist only under the control of the military elite. For supporters of this ideology, the army embodies discipline, honesty and national unity, and its intervention in politics is an act of protecting the state and the people from chaos."
 patrimonialist_subtype_desc: "Patrimonialism is an ideology in which the state is personified by the personality of a ruler or dynasty. Supreme power can be exercised either directly by a strong person, including the monarch, or through a narrow circle of close associates or representatives of the elite, including the military. Despite his unlimited powers, the ruler is not perceived as a tyrant: on the contrary, his power is considered natural or even sacred, often elevated to the level of deification. In some countries, patrimonialism takes the form of absolute rule, secondly, it combines the tradition of monarchical power with the limited participation of the aristocracy or the military elite, and thirdly, an authoritarian personalistic regime that disguises itself as the tradition of «people's power»."
 national_populist_subtype_desc: "National Populism is a product of the confluence of right-wing ultranationalist movements arising in a changing world and describes governments that seek to harness the energy of the people for frequently radical ends. Often harbouring a disdain for traditional democracy and tapping on mass disaffection with the establishment, many turn to eclectic inspirations to solve leading issues."
 national_radicalist_subtype_desc: "National Radicalism is a radical right-wing ideology that pushes the ideas of national populism to the limit. It is based on the idea of the nation as the highest and only value, and the state is considered only as an instrument of its elevation and expansion. National radicals proclaim the total mobilization of society, the cult of the leader and the violent transformation of the world for the sake of national revival. Their regimes strive for the complete destruction of dissent and a ruthless struggle against "internal enemies" and "alien elements." For national radicals, war is not just a means of politics, but the natural state of the nation, hardening it and ensuring historical greatness."
 mysticist_subtype_desc: "Mysticism is the political and religious teaching of a number of numerous secret organizations that operate all over the planet to destroy existing nations and states in order to cleanse humanity from corruption, bureaucracy and exploitation by creating a single Mysterium - an ultra-ideologized social system of universal anonymity, constant alternation of master's roles, ostarkism of apostates, antimaterialist asceticism, which will be consolidated by codified morality around the cult of the Demiurge."
