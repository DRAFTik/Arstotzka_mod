### Subtype Descriptions ###
 totalist_subtype_desc: "Totalism is a synecdoche for governments inspired by the various totalitarian, vanguardist or extremely authoritarian branches of socialism. Named after the various socialist nationalist parties that came together to sign the Totalist Charter, many other authoritarian socialist movements globally have been associated with them, sometimes to their chagrin."
 syndicalist_subtype_desc: "Syndicalism is the one of the revolutionary ideologies in the world, an evolution of older union-focused socialist currents that went from an insurgent form of direct action to a system of government. Often combining industrial and libertarian socialism, many modern syndicalist governments take inspiration from the systems pioneered in Arstotzka though plenty inject new or local ideas of their own."
 radical_socialist_subtype_desc: "Radical Socialism encompasses a broad array of revolutionary leftist governments, and these factions reject political reformism within reactionary structures as the ultimate means of changing the status quo. The diverse strains of Radical Socialism can range significantly in belief, but share a common desire to see a drastically different future than what the old order had to offer."
 social_democrat_subtype_desc: "Social Democracy represents various governments led by reformist leftist groups who reject the inherent need for violent class struggle to achieve their aims, sometimes clashing with their more radical peers in the process. Many call instead for change via the ballot, though if push comes to shove revolutionaries of this type are not unheard of."
 social_liberal_subtype_desc: "Social Liberalism reflects many governing styles of the progressive liberal tradition, often pushing for change in the social contract to meet the growing demands of the people. These governments tend to focus on expanding or protecting civil liberties through both political and economic reforms, though their objectives vary from nation to nation."
 market_liberal_subtype_desc: "Market Liberal governments are derived from classical liberalism, and have their roots in various Enlightenment philosophies. Espousing the sanctity of the freedom of the individual and typically championing representative government and free enterprise, this category represents a broad assortment of groups including free market liberals, national liberals and conservative liberals."
 social_conservative_subtype_desc: "Social Conservativism encompasses many democratic governments that seek to preserve, uphold, or reinforce their peoples' traditional values in face of changing circumstances. Its adherents are not rigidly reactionary, being generally supportive of the rule of law and democracy, and willing to seek measured, incremental changes that align with their ethos within the political systems they inhabit."
 authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc: "Authoritarian Democracy describes a broad line-up of partially representative governmental systems characterised by powerful figures and interest groups ruling through the appearance of free legislature. While sometimes a product of ideological conviction or just plain pragmatism, other times this political structure has emerged due to weak or transitional elected institutions."
 paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc: "Paternal Autocracy is often more of a mindset than an ideology, and paternal autocratic governments sometimes explicitly denounce ideological partisanship. Often calling for a strong, wise leader such as a King, General or Cleric to protect and guide the people, its domineering nature has not prevented practitioners from holding sway over the masses."
 national_populist_subtype_desc: "National Populism is a product of the confluence of right-wing ultranationalist movements arising in a changing world and describes governments that seek to harness the energy of the people for frequently radical ends. Often harbouring a disdain for traditional democracy and tapping on mass disaffection with the establishment, many turn to eclectic inspirations to solve leading issues."
